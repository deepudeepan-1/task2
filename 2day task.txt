1. Difference between Browser js   vs Node js

   BROWSER jS:
   
   1. Where we can execute our javascript code with the help of console.
   2. Browserjs (sandboxed), which means embedded.
   3. console is a example for browserjs.
   4. To run Browserjs we need <script>filename.js</script>.
   5.Here  javascript runs in front end. 

   NODE JS: 
  
   1. kind of application has to be install in our local system , then a parse should be setup to execute the program.
   2. Nodejs is (stripped),which means it is separate application.
   3. Guvi IDE example of nodejs.
   4. Syntax to run Nodejs is (node filename.js).
   5. Here javascript runs in back end. 

2. How does the browser rendering a website ?

   1.Rendering means display(showing) something, HTML parser and CSS parser layout that render tree.then it will paint according to our data.
   2.if we make a mistake  other languages will throw an error whereas HTML will recover it.
   3.html parser handles even we missed some improper tag its shows output.
   4.css object model and that will go into and create whats called the render.
   5.multiple trees like Render objects , Render styles, Render layers ,Line boxes.

4. different type of data is there we can find what type of data we have given by using typeof.
   console.log(typeof(1));        =>this is NUMBER data type.
   console.log(typeof(1.1));      => this is float number but in javascript is considered as NUMBER data type.
   console.log(typeof('1.1'));    =>this is STRING data type , anything between single and double quotes is string.
   console.log(typeof(true));     =>this is BOOLEAN data type , it gives true or false. 
   console.log(typeof(null));     =>this is OBJECT data type.
   console.log(typeof(undefined));=>this is UNDEFINED data type, where we declare a variable but we didnt access or assign it.
   console.log(typeof([]));       =>this is an OBJECT data type , where we can store multiple data in different types. 
   console.log(typeof({}));       =>this is an OBJECT data type , where we can store multiple  data in key pair value 
   console.log(typeof(NaN));      =>this is NUMBER data type
